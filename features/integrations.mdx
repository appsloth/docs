## Overview

Adding OAuth integrations to your application is complex and time-consuming. AppSloth's OAuth service handles everything from secure credential storage to user authentication flows, with pre-built components that handle the entire connection experience.

## Supported Integrations

AppSloth currently supports Slack, GitHub, and Linear integrations, with more platforms coming soon based on customer demand.

## How It Works

Set up your OAuth credentials in AppSloth, drop in our pre-built components, and start interacting with connected services through our SDK. All credentials are encrypted and automatically rotated for security.

## Setting Up

### 1. Add Provider Credentials

Add your OAuth credentials in the AppSloth Dashboard:

| Setting         | Description                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `Provider`      | Select the integration         |
| `Client ID`     | Your OAuth app's client ID     |
| `Client Secret` | Your OAuth app's client secret |
| `Scopes`        | Required permission scopes     |

### 2. Add the Connect Component

Our pre-built components handle the entire integration experience:

```jsx
// For Slack
<ConnectSlack customerId="user-123" />

// For Linear
<ConnectLinear customerId="user-123" />
```

The components provide a complete user experience: connection button, OAuth flow, workspace configuration, and integration testing. Users can connect their accounts and verify the integration works in minutes.

## Using Connected Services

Interact with connected services through our simple SDK:

```typescript
// Send messages to Slack
await appsloth.slack.sendMessage({
  customerId: "user-123",
  message: "Hello from AppSloth!",
});

// Create Linear issues
await appsloth.linear.createIssue({
  customerId: "user-123",
  title: "New feature request",
  description: "User requested...",
});
```

## Integration Dashboard
