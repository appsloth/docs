## Overview

AppSloth Status Pages provide real-time monitoring of your endpoints and a public-facing status page for your customers. The system automatically checks your endpoints every 5 minutes and maintains an uptime history, making it easy to communicate service status to your users.

## Setting Up Endpoints

Through the AppSloth Dashboard, you can easily configure endpoints to monitor. Each endpoint can be configured with:

| Configuration       | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Name`              | A display name for the endpoint (e.g., "API Health Check", "Authentication Service") |
| `Scheme`            | Choose between HTTP or HTTPS                                                         |
| `Hostname`          | The host to monitor (e.g., "api.example.com")                                        |
| `Path`              | The specific path to check (e.g., "/health", "/status")                              |
| `Port`              | Optional port number if not using standard HTTP/HTTPS ports                          |
| `Public Visibility` | Whether this endpoint should be visible on your public status page                   |
| `Authentication`    | Optional bearer token authentication for secured endpoints                           |

### Best Practices for Endpoints

When setting up your endpoints:

1. **Health Check Endpoints**: Create dedicated health check endpoints that return a 200 status code
2. **Response Time**: Keep your health check endpoints lightweight to ensure accurate monitoring
3. **Authentication**: Use bearer token authentication for sensitive endpoints
4. **Public vs Private**: Only make endpoints public that are relevant to your customers
5. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive names that your customers will understand

## Public Status Page

Each project automatically gets a public status page at `https://status.appsloth.com/[project-id]`. Your status page includes:

- Real-time status of all public endpoints
- 90-day uptime history
- Current incident information
- Historical incident records

### Customization Options

Through the dashboard, you can customize your status page:

1. **Branding**

   - Add your company logo
   - Set custom colors to match your brand
   - Add a custom domain (Enterprise plan)

2. **Component Groups**

   - Group related endpoints together
   - Create logical service categories
   - Set custom labels for each group

3. **Metrics Display**
   - Configure which metrics to show
   - Set custom thresholds for status indicators
   - Choose between percentage or time-based uptime display

## Incident Management

When issues occur, you can create incidents through the dashboard. Each incident can:

- Be linked to specific affected endpoints
- Include status updates over time
- Show investigation progress
- Provide resolution details

The status page automatically updates to reflect current incidents and their status.

## Monitoring Dashboard

The AppSloth Dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring information:

1. Log into your [AppSloth Dashboard](https://dashboard.appsloth.com)
2. Navigate to the "Status" section
3. View your endpoints:
   - Current status indicators
   - Uptime percentages
   - Response time graphs
